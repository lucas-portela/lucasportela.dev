    description: `Lead by PhD Mamede Lima-Marques, CPAI (in english IARC - Information Architecture Research Center) is a research center at University of Brasilia
      where the main field of study is Information Architecture. During my 3 years as a trainee,
      I had personal Formal Logic classes with Mamede and other academics. I also researched
      and developed 2 projects in the field with functional prototypes, ALP (in english PLA - Propositional Logic Analyzer) and LOG++, wich I presented
      in the V Colloquy of Information Architecture, an event that occurred in 2015 at UnB.
      The project LOG++ was adapted by me and evolved to a new project whose name was SARC (in english ASCR - Accessible
        System of Cognitive Robotics). SARC was the  presented in the V MNR
        (in english 5th National Robotics Show) representing UnB.`,

    for developing all the technology from scratch. I built the back-end on top of Traccar, an open-source
    tracking system written in Java. With this stable back-end as starting point, I wrote the protocol
    implementations for Suntech and GlobalStar trackers. I also wrote some modifications, adding new features 
    in the core of Traccar to supply business specific demands, including integrations with firebase APIs
    and remodeling entities of the database. When I left the company, being almost the only one active
    developer, I left them with a complete functional product, wich they use till today.`,

    They had some big IT contracts with the government of Brazil and their tech stack was a little
    outdated when I came there. So my mission was to bring innovation to new products, since I was
    an experienced JavaScript developer, working with reactive layouts, realtime database and stuff like
    that. The first and only project I built there was a system responsible for managing  the logistics
    inside a shed. The system was composed of a digital totem and a back-end service connected to RFID
    readers through MQTT subscriptions. Before completing 3 months and having the project done, I got a
    invite from another company offering a higher payment and so I aggreed to work to them and leave
    LinkData.`,

    things in record time and dealing with the arbitrary desires of unaware clients by my own, without a team.
    But at Synapse Brasil I was part of a team for the first time and I had time to evolve my view and ideas
    on software engineering. There I worked with NodeJS, Laravel, MongoDB, Angular, Vue, Payment Processing,
    routine automation and made some friends.`,

    that are very rare in IT companies here. Some of wich ASI Company could give, so I jumped in and here
    I am till today. At ASI Company I work at the innovation team. Some of my recent impact at the company
    was my expertise developing a BPMN process system prototype in 5 weeks, which was crucial to the
