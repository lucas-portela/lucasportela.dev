    description: `Led by PhD Mamede Lima-Marques, CPAI (Information Architecture Research Center) is a research center at University of Brasilia where the main field of study is Information Architecture. During my 3 years as a trainee, I participated in the development team of a Computer Vision solution with OpenCV that would analyze and validate the 3x4 document photos sent by college entrance exam candidates. I Also had personal Formal Logic classes with Mamede and other academics. After the first year I developed 2 projects in the formal logic field with functional prototypes: ALP (Propositional Logic Analyzer) and LOG++, which I presented in the V Colloquy of Information Architecture, an event that occurred in 2015 at UnB.`,

    description: `When we talk about digital marketing agencies, we find some companies where there is no space for challenging solutions, back-end development and stuff like that, so things get a bit repetitive and mechanical. Therefore I didn't spend much time working at Boa Imagem. But it was a relevant experience since I had contact with the leading CMS (WordPress) and learned some digital marketing concepts.`,

    description: `AXSAT was created just before I came, so I was responsible for developing all the technology from scratch. I built the back-end on top of Traccar, an open-source tracking system written in Java. Having this stable back-end as a starting point, I wrote protocol implementations for Suntech and GlobalStar trackers. I also wrote some modifications, adding new features to the core of Traccar, supplying business specific demands, including integrations with firebase APIs and database entity remodeling. I left the company leaving them with a complete functional product, which they use till today.`,

    description: `Few months later I was hired by LinkData through the networking I built at AXSAT. They had some big IT contracts with the government of Brazil and their tech stack was a little outdated when I camE. So my mission was to bring innovation to new products, since I was an experienced JavaScript developer, working with reactive layouts, realtime databases and stuff like that. The first and only project I built there was a system responsible for managing the logistics inside a shed. The system was composed of a digital totem and a back-end service connected to RFID readers through MQTT subscriptions. Before completing 3 months and having the project done, I got an invite from another company offering a higher salary and so I decided to move on and work for them, leaving LinkData.`,

Till now I was always running against deadlines, delivering things in record time and dealing with the arbitrary desires of unaware clients on my own, without a team. But at Synapse Brasil I was part of a team for the first time and I had time to evolve my view and ideas on software engineering. There I worked with Flutter, NodeJS, Laravel, MongoDB, Angular, Vue, Payment Processing and made some friends.`,
